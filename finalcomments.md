Unfortunately, you had a stray slash at the bottom of your sketch file that prevented the code from running. However, I removed the slash and reloaded the page, so you didn't lose any points in the other categories because of that.

# Interactivity
Extensive interaction with both the drawing and the color switching. The entire thing works really well (when it works!).

# Code quality
You solved the knotty problem of capturing where a user is clicking and acting accordingly. Also, great use of push() and pop().

# Aesthetics
The project looks great and is a great idea, executed well. I strongly suggest putting this on your eventual DS portfolio!
